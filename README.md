## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Maramessa/code-html/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

The <HTML> is a markup language which is used by the browser to manipulate text, images and other content to display it in required format.

# Tags in HTML: Tags are one of the most important part in an HTML Document. HTML uses some predefined tags which tells the browser about content display property, that is how to display a particular given content. For Example, to create a paragraph, one must use the paragraph tags(<p> </p>) and to insert an image one must use the img tags(<img />).
## new HTML5 Elements
The most interesting new HTML5 elements are: 

1- New semantic elements like <header>, <footer>, <article>, and <section>.

New attributes of form elements like number, date, time, calendar, and range.

New graphic elements: <svg> and <canvas>.

New multimedia elements: <audio> and <video>.

# Many web sites contain HTML code like: <div id="nav"> <div class="header"> <div id="footer">
to indicate navigation, header, and footer.

HTML5 offers new semantic elements to define different parts of a web page:
<article>
<aside>
<details>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>
<header>
<main>
<mark>
<nav>
<section>
<summary>
<time>
